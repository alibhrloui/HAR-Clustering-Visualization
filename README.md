# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Clustering and Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the analysis of the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The notebook focuses on clustering the data using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and visualizing the results in both 3D and 2D space.

## 1. Introduction
In this notebook, we explore the UCI HAR dataset to understand its structure and apply GMM for clustering. The goal is to uncover underlying patterns in the data and visualize them for further analysis.

## 2. Dataset Exploration
We start by loading and exploring the UCI HAR dataset to gain insights into the number of samples, features, and classes.

## 3. Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Application of GMM with six components for clustering the dataset.

## 4. Evaluate Cluster Purity and Silhouette Score
Assessment of the clustering quality using Cluster Purity and Silhouette Score.

## 5. Dimensionality Reduction for Visualization
Utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality for both 3D and 2D visualization.

## 6. 3D Scatter Plot
Creation of a 3D scatter plot to visualize clustering results in three-dimensional space.

## 7. 2D Scatter Plots
Generation of three 2D scatter plots on different planes for detailed visualization.

## Usage
To run the notebook locally, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook HAR_Clustering_Visualization.ipynb
```


Feel free to explore and use the notebook for your analysis or as a reference for similar projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue.

Happy coding!
